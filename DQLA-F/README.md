# DQLA-F
Design files for FPGA Interface board, used in Dual Quad Linear Amplifier (DQLA) system

This board routes the I/O signals from the attached FPGA board to the two 50-pin flat flex cables,
which connect to the DLQA-Q board and ultimately to the two QLAs. It also contains the safety
circuit, including safety relay, safety chain connectors and status LEDs.
